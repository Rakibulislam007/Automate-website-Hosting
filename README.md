# Automate-website-Hosting
The idea for this project is to learn about the automation of website hosting while learning bash scripting
Host a ready-made website using bash scripting
This is a simple and quick project where I host a website from tooplate.com on the local machine.
the whole process has been automated with the bash scripting.
